**Installation**\
Unzip the file contents and double click on the dashes you want to install.\

Please copy TWF_DASH_HELPER.JS and TWF_DASH_CONFIG.JSON under C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\JavascriptExtensions for TWF Dashes to work.\

You can customize TWF_DASH_CONFIG.JSON file to add your name, number and color to dashes.\

If you run multiple DDUs and do not want the same alerts and flags to appear on all, you can also turn alerts and flags on/off based on each dash.\
