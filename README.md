Deltas might not work in RF2.

# Installation

 Download the [latest release](https://github.com/hakanuzunoglu/TWF-Dash/releases/). 
- Unzip the file contents and double click on the dashes you want to install. 
- Copy **TWF_DASH_HELPER.JS** and **TWF_DASH_CONFIG.JSON** under **C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\JavascriptExtensions**


You can customize TWF_DASH_CONFIG.JSON file to add your name, number and color to dashes.

If you run multiple DDUs and do not want the same alerts and flags to appear on all, you can also turn alerts and flags on/off based on each dash.
